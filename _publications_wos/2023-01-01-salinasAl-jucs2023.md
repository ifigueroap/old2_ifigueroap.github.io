# Abstract

Many factors influence the problems that currently exist in the
learning-teaching process of programming. The use of an Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) makes the experience a complicated process because these IDEs
focus on professional programmers and not on novice learners. This also affects
the classrooms of the university “Pontificia Universidad Cat´olica de
Valpara´ıso (PUCV)” (Chile). The use of professional IDEs negatively affects
the learning process of first-year students who face the development of the
algorithms for the first time. One of the IDE widely used for teaching
programming courses is Code::Blocks, which is a tool for professional
developers. Through a heuristic and usability evaluation, we found that
Code::Blocks has a complex user interface and a functional overload. Using
these two findings, as well as recommendations given during these tests, we
highlight the important aspects that an IDE for novice learners should have.
Taking into account previous observations and state-of-the-art/practice of
IDEs, a functional IDE prototype, named Incre-IDLE, is developed. In addition
to Code::Blocks evaluations, this paper reports the results of a heuristic and
usability evaluation applied to first-year students at PUCV about
functionalities provided by Incre-IDLE. These results suggest that Incre-IDLE
has a simple interface, is easy to install and use, and does not have
functional overload (i.e., spend a considerable amount of time learning the
tool). Concretely, the results show that 66.7% of the students could complete
tasks easily and 100% of them found the GUI intuitive. In terms of GUI, 83.3%
considered the application interface “very simple”; and the text, concepts, and
icons “very understandable” by 66.7%. The students also found the tool
“motivating” (66.7%) or “very motivating” (33.3%). These results closely match
the findings obtained by the heuristic evaluation of Incre-IDLE from the
experts: 83.3% of them rated it as “useful” or “very useful”, and only a 16.7%
rated it as “useless”.
