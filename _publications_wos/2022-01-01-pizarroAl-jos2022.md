# Abstract

Spain ranks second in the world for the number of international tourists. These
tourists have different preferences, which influence their choice of tourist
routes depending on the activities offered by provinces. There are currently no
routes customised according to the preferences of a travel party, which makes
the supply of tourist packages complex. We propose an agentbased model, named
ABM RoutePlanner, which simulates the behaviour of travel parties through
provinces of Spain. The model is developed as an application of the ODD
protocol. This paper makes two contributions. First, we describe a model
applicable to the identification of appropriate routes for different
combinations of tourists’ preferences in some (hypothetical) environments.
Second, we present the actual routes that will allow tour operators to define
strategic plans that motivate tourists to visit the provinces included in the
routes. The simulation model was calibrated with data extracted from
TripAdvisor and Spanish tourist surveys.
