Hi everyone!


I've finally decided to have a blog on my personal website. Future posts will
include topics related to software development, leadership, as well as music,
games, or whatever I feel like posting.


The main purpose of the blog is for allowing myself to express on these topics,
as well as serving as reference for my future self. Feel free to subscribe to
the RSS feed and to drop an email (see the address at the end of the [Home](/) section)


kthx, bye!
