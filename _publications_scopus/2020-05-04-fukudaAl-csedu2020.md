# Abstract

System-level details, such as assembly language and operating systems, are
important to develop/debug embedded systems and analyze malware. Therefore it
is recommended to teach every topic of these subjects. However, their learning
cost has been significantly increased due to current system complexities. To
solve this problem, several visualization techniques have been proposed to help
students in their learning process. However, observing only the computer system
behaviors may be insufficient to apply it to real systems due to the lack of
practical experiences and a comprehensive understanding of system-level
details. To address these issues, we propose a novel methodology where students
implement a virtual machine instead of using existing ones. This virtual
machine needs to execute binary programs that can be run on a real operating
system. Through implementing this virtual machine, students improve by
experience their understanding of computer architecture, assembly languages,
instruction sets, and the role of operating systems. We also provide MMVM that
is a virtual machine implementation reference, and can execute the binary
programs while showing the internal states of CPU (registers & flags) to users
(students) to support their implementation. Finally, this paper reports the
education results applying this methodology to 15 students that consist of
3rd-year students and 1st year of master students.
